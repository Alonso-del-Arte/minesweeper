# Minesweeper

An implementation of the well-known video game as a standalone Java Swing application.

Although in most people's minds the Minesweeper game is closely associated with Microsoft and the earliest versions of the Windows operating system, the general idea of the game seems to be public domain.

I am aware that a few years ago Roberto Virga at Carnegie Mellon University did a Java implementation that was intended for use as an applet in a Web browser. I'm guessing it was a pure AWT application. As of December 19, 2020, I have not looked at any of his source.

This project uses JUnit 4. Initially, NetBeans set it up as a JUnit 5 project, but I'm missing something to enable NetBeans to run JUnit 5, so I changed it to JUnit 4.
